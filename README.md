## 📐 LDU Factorization Calculator

A web-based tool to perform LDU matrix factorization and verify the decomposition using matrix multiplication. Built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project provides an interactive and visual approach to understanding numerical linear algebra concepts.

***

## 🚀 Features

Supports n × n matrices (2 ≤ n ≤ 5)

Computes LDU decomposition such that
                                 A=L×D×U

Displays:

Lower Triangular Matrix (L)

Diagonal Matrix (D)

Upper Triangular Matrix (U)

Verification module reconstructs the original matrix using L×D×U

Clean and responsive dashboard-style UI

No external libraries or frameworks used
